Vesselize is a JavaScript IoC container inspired by the Nest framework. It can easily integrate with Vue.js, React and other frameworks quickly.

Through Vesselize, you can easily use instances anywhere and resolve their dependencies, thereby reducing the complexity of large-scale Web applications.

## Concepts

- **Providers** - Providers are the classes, factory methods, or any values that can be used to register in the Vesselize container.
- **Container** - A container is used to create, manage, and query instances.
- **Context** - A context can hold independent instances.
